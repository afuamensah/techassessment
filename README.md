# Technical Assessment - Pop's Tops Store

First, after downloading the Wordpress zipped folder, I extracted it and moved it to the htdocs folder in XAMPP.

I then created a database using PHPMYAdmin called techtest.

After completing the starting steps, I created a child theme of the parent Twenty Twenty-One theme. Here are the steps I took to do it.
1. I created a folder called "twentytwentyone-child" in the wp-content/themes folder.
2. In the folder I created a style.css file and added a header comment.
3. Then, in the same folder, I created a functions.php file and enqueued the theme.
4. After that, I went back to the theme page in Wordpress and found the child theme.
5. Upon finding it I activated the theme to the site.
